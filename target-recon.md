* monday 9:30pm --> 11:15pm

**location:** room 32

## Technical Recon

### VULNERABILITY
the smart screen computer grants everyone admin privileges

### THREAT:
the exams/quizes files getting leaked or deleted

### INFORMATION 
every time the target gives a lecture in the previously specified times, he uses the smart screen computer to veiw the pdf files from the usb on the projector, after being in the front row I could see that he keeps the exams and maybe final exam there, the computer admin user - also the only user - doesn't have a password.
all the student leave the lecture room after the lecture which leaves the attacker an opening to plant the malicious scripts and download the files unseen.
